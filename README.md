My Econ 690 Final Project: A thorough look through Chicago Crime data, from 2001-present

This repository includes the data, code, and report for my Econ 690 Project. 
The report does not include all of the figures I made, as there was a page limit. I advise you check out the source code, which includes all of the figures and data-wrangling for the project. This is all in the Project.ipynb file
