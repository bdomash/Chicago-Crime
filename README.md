# Chicago-Crime
My Econ 690 Final Project: A thorough look through Chicago Crime data, from 2001-present

This repository includes the data, code, the project report, and some of the files used to gather data. The full crime dataset was far too big to upload, but can be found and downloaded here: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2 

I advise you check out the source code, which includes all of the figures and data-wrangling for the project. This is all in the Project.ipynb file
